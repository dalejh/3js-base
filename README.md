A modular implementation of 3js. We'll want to plop an instance of World into our React project, hook it up to our event system for state emission, and go from there.

opportunities for improvement:

-   [x] formatter (prettier) runs on pre-commit
-   [] linter runs on pre-commit
-   [] improve tsconfig/prettier config/etc
